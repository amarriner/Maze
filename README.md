Maze
====

* Builds a random maze for the player to traverse *

On page load, the game builds a maze and places the player in it as well as a random end point. There is fog preset which obscures a player's vision outside of a one square radius. The player has 10 breadcrumbs to place somewhere in the maze. Each breadcrumb will illuminate fogged areas with a one square radius.
